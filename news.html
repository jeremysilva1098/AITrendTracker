<h2>Title: My Surprisingly Unbiased Week With Elon Musk's 'Politically Biased' Chatbot</h2>
<h3>Source: Wired</h3>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>- Elon Musk's chatbot, Grok, built by his company xAI, has been criticized by some users for being politically liberal, contrary to Musk's right-leaning political views.</li>
<li>- Musk has acknowledged the problem and stated that xAI will work to reduce Grok's political bias in the future.</li>
<li>- An analysis of Grok's responses found that it exhibits a strong libertarian streak but also leans left on certain topics.</li>
<li>- It is challenging to completely remove bias from AI language models, and attempts to do so may result in dull and neutered chatbots.</li>
<li>- Grok's performance is currently less advanced than other cutting-edge chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT. It is prone to hallucinations and can be easily tricked.</li>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>- OpenAI's Superalignment team, led by Ilya Sutskever, is working on guiding the behavior of superintelligent AI models as they become more advanced.</li>
