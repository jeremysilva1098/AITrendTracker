<h1>Top AI Blog Posts of the Week</h1>
<h2>Title: The 1xers Guide to LLM, ChatGPT and AI</h2>
<h3>Source: Pythonforengineers.com</h3>
<h4>Summary:</h4>
<ul>
<li>LLMs (Large Language Models) are computer programs that can understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human languages.</li>
<li>LLMs have been trained on large amounts of data and can generate text that sounds intelligent.</li>
<li>Commercial LLMs like ChatGPT are advanced and provide detailed answers, while open source LLMs like LLama 2 are catching up.</li>
<li>Running LLMs locally on your machine can be done using tools like Ollama or Mozilla's LLamafile.</li>
<li>LLMs can also be used for generating images, but caution must be taken to avoid copyright infringements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Title: How close are we to peak AI?</h2>
<h3>Source: Business Insider</h3>
<h4>Summary:</h4>
<ul>
<li>No AI model has been able to outperform OpenAI's GPT-4 since its release in March.</li>
<li>There are questions about whether generative AI, the most popular form of AI, is already peaking in terms of performance.</li>
<li>While increases in performance are theoretically possible, they are harder to achieve in practice.</li>
<li>Google's AI model, Gemini Ultra, barely outperforms GPT-4 on performance benchmarks.</li>
<li>The industry is still hopeful for a significant jump in performance, but there may be limitations to transformer models like GPT-4.</li>
</ul>
