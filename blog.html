<h2>Title: Anthropic says its latest AI bot can beat Gemini and ChatGPT</h2>
<h3>Source: The Verge</h3>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anthropic has released the next generation of its AI models, Claude 3, which is now multimodal and claims to outperform leading models from Google and OpenAI.</li>
<li>Claude 3 models can answer more questions, understand longer instructions, and provide more accurate results by processing more context and information.</li>
<li>The models are less likely to refuse to answer prompts and can give near-instant results even when handling dense material like research papers.</li>
<li>Opus, the largest model, outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4 in graduate-level reasoning and showed better performance in math questions, coding, and reasoning tasks.</li>
<li>Anthropic trained the Claude 3 models using a mix of internal and third-party datasets, with investments from Amazon and Google, and the models will be available on AWS and Google's Vertex AI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Title: Here's everything you need to know about Gemini 1.5, Google's newly updated AI model that hopes to challenge OpenAI</h2>
<h3>Source: Business Insider</h3>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Google is developing Gemini 1.5, a next-gen AI model designed to be a personal assistant and business tool.</li>
<li>Gemini 1.5 uses a "mixture of experts" model for efficiency and has a bigger context window, allowing it to analyze more data.</li>
<li>In benchmark tests, Gemini 1.5 outperformed its predecessors in 87% of the tests and was able to find small pieces of text in large blocks of data.</li>
<li>Google conducted extensive ethics and safety testing on Gemini 1.5 to mitigate potential harm.</li>
<li>Gemini 1.5 is meant to rival competitors like OpenAI's GPT-4.</li>
