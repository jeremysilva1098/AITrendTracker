  <h2>Title: Apple’s AI ambitions could include Google or OpenAI</h2>
  <h3>Source: The Verge</h3>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple is reportedly in active negotiations with Google to bring its Gemini generative AI technology to the iPhone.</li>
    <li>The AI features built into Apple's products could eventually be powered by a mix of first- and third-party AI models, with on-device generative AI powered by Apple's own models and cloud-based AI features potentially coming via partnerships with companies like Google.</li>
    <li>If a deal is reached, Google's AI tools would expand their reach to over 2 billion Apple devices in the market.</li>
    <li>However, entering a potential AI deal with Google could be seen as a concession from Apple that its own generative AI technology is lagging behind its competitors.</li>
    <li>The announcement of any AI deal is unlikely to happen before WWDC in June.</li>
