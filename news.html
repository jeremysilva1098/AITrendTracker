  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The European Union has reached a preliminary agreement for the AI Act, which is the first successful attempt at AI regulation.</li>
    <li>The AI Act aims to curb potential risks of advanced automation and misinformation, focusing on limiting malicious applications of AI such as predictive policing and manipulating human behavior.</li>
    <li>Big tech companies will be targeted under the "high-risk systems" provisions, requiring compliance with transparency requirements and potential fines of up to 7% of revenue for non-compliance.</li>
    <li>The AI Act still needs formal adoption, but its enactment is highly likely, although the provisions may not be enforceable for another year or two.</li>
