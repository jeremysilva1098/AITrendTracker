<h2>Title: Leeroo Orchestrator: Elevating LLMs Performance Through Model Integration</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The paper proposes an architecture called Leeroo Orchestrator to harness the collective knowledge of multiple trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</li>
<li>The Leeroo Orchestrator intelligently selects the most suitable expert model for each input based on predefined criteria such as speed, cost, and accuracy, thus optimizing resource utilization.</li>
<li>The results show that the Leeroo Orchestrator achieves performance on par with the best open-source LLM models while incurring lower costs. It also outperforms closed-source LLM models with significant cost reductions.</li>
<li>The architecture utilizes a self-play loop to generate training data for the orchestrator, continuously improving its decision-making and adaptability.</li>
<li>The paper demonstrates that the Leeroo Orchestrator can create cost-effective LLMs by optimizing the synergy between multiple models, offering superior performance outcomes.</li>

<h2>Title: Towards Goal-oriented Large Language Model Prompting: A Survey</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various downstream tasks, and prompt engineering plays a crucial role in optimizing their performance.</li>
<li>A goal-oriented prompt formulation, which guides LLMs to mimic human thinking, significantly improves their performance.</li>
<li>Goal-oriented prompting methods can be categorized into five stages: goal decomposition, action selection, action implementation, sub-goal result evaluation, and sub-goal selection.</li>
<li>Goal-oriented prompt engineering has been successfully applied to tasks such as reasoning, planning, question answering, code generation, dialogue, and recommendation.</li>
<li>Challenges and opportunities for future research include the synergy of stages, application to other tasks, improving efficiency, and exploring hierarchical decomposition for complex problems.</li>

<h2>Title: Prompt Weight Experiments for LLM Instruction Fine-Tuning</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The study analyzed the effect of prompt token classification loss weighting (PLW) on the performance of large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on instruction tasks.</li>
<li>Models fine-tuned on short-completion instruction data showed a negative quadratic relationship with PLW, while models fine-tuned on long-completion datasets were unaffected by PLW.</li>
<li>Prompt loss weight has a statistically significant relationship with model performance on downstream tasks when training on short-completion instruction data.</li>
<li>PLW has no significant effect on downstream performance for models trained on long-completion data.</li>
<li>Models fine-tuned on short-completion data with an optimal PLW value performed best on certain instruction-based benchmarks.</li>

<h2>Title: ChatGraph: Chat with Your Graphs</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The paper introduces ChatGraph, a framework that allows users to interact with graphs through natural language, making graph analysis easier and more flexible.</li>
<li>ChatGraph consists of three main modules: an API retrieval module that searches for relevant APIs, a graph-aware LLM module that enables the language model to understand graphs, and an API chain-oriented finetuning module that guides the model in generating API chains.</li>
<li>The graph-aware LLM module transforms graphs into paths using a graph sequentializer, and the API chain-oriented finetuning module ensures that the generated API chains match the ground-truth API chains.</li>
<li>The framework supports various scenarios, including graph understanding, graph comparison, graph cleaning, and API chain monitoring.</li>
<li>The paper demonstrates the usability and efficiency of ChatGraph in real-world scenarios using diverse graph datasets.</li>
