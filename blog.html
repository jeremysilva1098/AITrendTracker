<h2>Article 1</h2>
<h3>Title: Show HN: My related-posts finder script (with LLM and GPT4 enhancement)</h3>
<h4>Source: Tomhazledine.com</h4>
<h4>Summary:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The author used LLM embeddings to find related posts for their blog and GPT4 to explain why they're similar.</li>
<li>Embeddings are a way to make LLMs actually useful without any concerns about "hallucination" or incorrect content.</li>
<li>The author tried manual approaches and leaning on CMS features to generate related posts in the past, but found limitations and difficulties.</li>
<li>Embeddings are a mathematical representation of the meaning of text and can be used for natural language search and calculating relations between content.</li>
<li>The author developed a node script that reads markdown files, generates embeddings, compares similarities, and uses GPT4 to generate explanations of why posts are similar.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Title: Intel Neural-Chat-7B Model Achieves Top Ranking on LLM Leaderboard</h3>
<h4>Source: Intel.com</h4>
<h4>Summary:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Intel neural-chat-7b model has achieved the #1 ranking for 7-billion-parameter models on the Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard.</li>
<li>The model achieved comparable accuracy scores to models 2-3x larger, making it suitable for deployment on a wide range of compute platforms.</li>
<li>The model is based on the Mistral-7B-v0.1 transformer model from Mistral AI and was fine-tuned using Intel Extension for Transformers with a supervised fine-tuning process.</li>
<li>Attaining the competitive benchmark score required a novel approach called direct preference optimization (DPO), which provides human preference feedback for training data.</li>
<li>The model can be used for inference by installing the proper libraries, loading the model, and performing inference, with examples available in the Intel Extension for Transformers GitHub repo.</li>
</ul>
