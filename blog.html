<h2>Title: The 1xers Guide to LLM, ChatGPT and AI</h2>
<h3>Source: Pythonforengineers.com</h3>
<h4>Summary:</h4>
<ul>
<li>LLMs (Large Language Models) are computer programs that can understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human languages in an intelligent way.</li>
<li>ChatGPT 4 is the most advanced version available, providing complex and detailed answers, while ChatGPT 3.5 is sufficient for most cases.</li>
<li>Open source LLMs, such as LLama 2 from Facebook, are catching up to commercial LLMs and offer generous usage limits.</li>
<li>Running LLMs locally on your machine can be achieved using tools like Ollama or Mozilla's LLamafile.</li>
<li>LLMs can also be used for image generation, but caution must be exercised to avoid copyright infringement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Title: An open source DuckDB text to SQL LLM</h2>
<h3>Source: Motherduck.com</h3>
<h4>Summary:</h4>
<ul>
<li>MotherDuck has released an open-source DuckDB specific text-to-SQL LLM (language model) called DuckDB-NSQL.</li>
<li>The goal of DuckDB-NSQL is to provide faster and less expensive inference for DuckDB applications.</li>
<li>The model was trained on synthetically generated DuckDB SQL queries and general Text-2-SQL questions.</li>
<li>DuckDB-NSQL is capable of generating DuckDB snippets and SQL queries for analytical questions.</li>
<li>Users can try out DuckDB-NSQL on Hugging Face to generate SQL snippets by providing natural language instructions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Title: MK1 Flywheel Unlocks the Full Potential of AMD Instinct for LLM Inference</h2>
<h3>Source: Mkone.ai</h3>
<h4>Summary:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The new inference engine MK1 Flywheel allows AMD Instinct Series to achieve comparable performance to a compute-matched NVIDIA GPU.</li>
<li>MK1 Flywheel demonstrates up to 3.7x higher throughput compared to vLLM, leading to significant cost savings.</li>
<li>AMD's Instinct MI300 series accelerator has the potential to challenge NVIDIA's market dominance for cloud AI workloads.</li>
<li>AMD's software ecosystem has improved, with native support for AMD hardware on popular AI frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.</li>
<li>Building and optimizing the hardware and software components for AMD Instinct was a challenging but rewarding journey, and further optimizations are still possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Title: RAG Using Unstructured Data and Role of Knowledge Graphs</h2>
<h3>Source: Kuzudb.com</h3>
<h4>Summary:</h4>
<ul>
<li>RAG systems can use unstructured data, such as text files or PDF documents, in addition to structured data.</li>
<li>Design decisions for RAG-U systems include what additional data to include (chunks of text, full documents, or extracted triples) and how to store and fetch this data.</li>
<li>The use of knowledge graphs (KGs) in RAG-U systems can help link chunks of text and retrieve more relevant information.</li>
<li>The availability and construction of KGs is an important consideration for RAG-U systems.</li>
<li>Future work in RAG-U includes exploring the use of matrices for embedding chunks, evaluating different graph heuristics for extracting chunks, and improving the extraction of knowledge graphs from unstructured documents.</li>
