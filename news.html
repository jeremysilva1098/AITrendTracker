<h2>Title: AI cannot be used to deny health care coverage, feds clarify to insurers</h2>
<h3>Source: Ars Technica</h3>
<h4>Summary:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has clarified that health insurance companies cannot use algorithms or artificial intelligence (AI) to determine care or deny coverage to members on Medicare Advantage plans.</li>
<li>The clarification comes after lawsuits were filed against UnitedHealth and Humana for using a flawed AI-powered tool called nH Predict to deny care to elderly patients on Medicare Advantage plans.</li>
<li>The CMS memo states that coverage decisions must be based on the individual patient's circumstances, and algorithms that determine coverage based on a larger data set instead of the patient's medical history or physician's recommendations would not be compliant.</li>
<li>Insurers must reassess the individual patient's condition and provide a specific and detailed explanation if care is denied, including the applicable coverage criteria and rules.</li>
<li>The CMS also warns insurers to ensure that any AI tools or algorithms used do not perpetuate or exacerbate existing bias or introduce new biases.</li>
