  <h2>Title: Show HN: My related-posts finder script (with LLM and GPT4 enhancement)</h2>
  <h3>Source: Tomhazledine.com</h3>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The author used LLM embeddings and GPT4 to find related posts for their blog.</li>
    <li>Embeddings are a way to make LLMs useful for natural language search without the worry of generating incorrect or "hallucinated" content.</li>
    <li>The author tried manual approaches and leaning on CMS features to generate related posts in the past but found limitations and drawbacks with both methods.</li>
    <li>Embeddings are mathematical representations of the meaning of text and can be used for calculating similarities between pieces of content.</li>
    <li>The author developed a node script that reads markdown files, generates embeddings and summaries, compares similarities, and updates the related posts data in the frontmatter of the files.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Title: Intel Neural-Chat-7B Model Achieves Top Ranking on LLM Leaderboard</h2>
  <h3>Source: Intel.com</h3>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The Intel neural-chat-7b model has achieved the #1 ranking for 7-billion-parameter models on the Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard.</li>
    <li>The model is at the low end of today's large language model sizes but achieved comparable accuracy scores to models 2-3x larger.</li>
    <li>The model is based on the Mistral-7B-v0.1 transformer model from Mistral AI and was fine-tuned using Intel Extension for Transformers.</li>
    <li>The fine-tuning process used direct preference optimization (DPO) which provides human preference feedback and is more computationally efficient than reinforcement learning.</li>
    <li>The model can be deployed on a wide range of compute platforms and there are examples available for fine-tuning and customizing the chatbot.</li>
  </ul>
