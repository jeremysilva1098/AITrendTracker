<h1>Top AI Blog Posts of the Week</h1>
<h2>Title: Show HN: My related-posts finder script (with LLM and GPT4 enhancement)</h2>
<h3>Source: Tomhazledine.com</h3>
<h4>Summary:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The author used LLM embeddings to find related posts for their blog and GPT4 to explain why they're similar.</li>
<li>Embeddings are a way to make LLMs useful for natural language search without the problem of "hallucination" or incorrect content.</li>
<li>The author tried a manual approach and leaning on CMS features to generate related posts in the past but found limitations and issues with both methods.</li>
<li>Embeddings are vectors that represent the meaning of text and can be used to calculate the similarity between different pieces of content.</li>
<li>The author developed a node script that reads markdown files, generates embeddings, and uses GPT4 to generate explanations for the similarity of posts.</li>
</ul>
