  <h2>Title: The 1xers Guide to LLM, ChatGPT and AI</h2>
  <h3>Source: Pythonforengineers.com</h3>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Large Language Models (LLMs) are computer programs that can understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human languages.</li>
    <li>LLMs can be trained on terabytes of data and have billions of parameters, allowing them to generate intelligent responses.</li>
    <li>ChatGPT is a popular commercial LLM, with ChatGPT 4 being the most advanced version available to paid users.</li>
    <li>Open source LLMs, such as LLama 2 from Facebook, have gained popularity and offer free usage for certain limits.</li>
    <li>Running LLMs locally on your machine can be done through tools like Ollama and Mozilla's LLamafile, which provide easy-to-use interfaces.</li>
    <li>LLMs can also be used for image generation, but caution must be taken to avoid copyright infringement.</li>
    <li>Following blogs like Ethan Mollick's and Simon Williamson's can help AI engineers stay up to date with advancements in the field.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Title: An open source DuckDB text to SQL LLM</h2>
  <h3>Source: Motherduck.com</h3>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>MotherDuck has released an open source DuckDB-specific text-to-SQL LLM model called DuckDB-NSQL.</li>
    <li>The model is trained on synthetic DuckDB SQL queries and general Text-2-SQL questions, making it capable of generating DuckDB snippets and SQL queries for analytical questions.</li>
    <li>DuckDB-NSQL is aware of all documented features in DuckDB 0.9.2, including official extensions, and can generate the exact DuckDB SQL query you are looking for.</li>
    <li>The model weights are fully released on Hugging Face and are also available in a quantized GGUF format for use with llama.cpp.</li>
    <li>You can try out DuckDB-NSQL on the Hugging Face space and prompt the model with natural language instructions to get SQL snippets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Title: RAG Using Unstructured Data and Role of Knowledge Graphs</h2>
  <h3>Source: Kuzudb.com</h3>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>RAG systems can use unstructured data, such as text files or PDF documents, in addition to structured data.</li>
    <li>Design decisions for RAG-U systems include what additional data to include (chunks of texts, full documents, or extracted triples) and how to store and fetch this data (vector indices or graph databases).</li>
    <li>Knowledge graphs (KGs) can be used in RAG-U systems to link chunks of text through relationships in the KG, allowing for more relevant information retrieval.</li>
    <li>The use of KGs in RAG-U systems raises the question of automatic knowledge graph construction, which is still an active research topic.</li>
    <li>There are multiple possibilities for future work in RAG-U systems, including exploring the use of matrices instead of vectors, evaluating different graph-based heuristics for chunk extraction, and improving the extraction of high-quality triples from unstructured documents.</li>
  </ul>
