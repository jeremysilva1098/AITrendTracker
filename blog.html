    <h2>The 1xers Guide to LLM, ChatGPT and AI</h2>
    <h3>Source: Pythonforengineers.com</h3>
    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>LLMs (Large Language Models) are computer programs that can understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human languages in an intelligent way.</li>
        <li>Commercial LLMs like ChatGPT are available, with ChatGPT 4 being the most advanced version. It provides detailed answers and is especially useful for writing essays.</li>
        <li>Open-source LLMs are catching up, with LLama 2 from Facebook gaining popularity. It can be used for free, even for commercial tools.</li>
        <li>Running LLMs locally on your machine can be done through tools like Ollama and Mozilla's LLamafile, which provide easy ways to run the models and come with web UIs.</li>
        <li>LLMs can also be used for image generation, but caution is needed to avoid copyright infringements.</li>
        <li>Recommended blogs to follow for AI-related topics are Ethan Mollick's and Simon Williamson's.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>An open source DuckDB text to SQL LLM</h2>
    <h3>Source: Motherduck.com</h3>
    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>DuckDB-NSQL is an open-source text-to-SQL language model specifically designed for DuckDB, a database management system.</li>
        <li>The model was trained on synthetic DuckDB SQL queries and general Text-2-SQL questions, making it capable of generating DuckDB snippets and SQL queries for analytical questions.</li>
        <li>It aims to improve the efficiency of data practitioners by shortening feedback loops and reducing the need to leave the query interface for documentation.</li>
        <li>Users can try out DuckDB-NSQL on the Hugging Face platform by prompting the model with a natural language instruction to generate SQL snippets.</li>
        <li>For a fully local experience, users can run DuckDB-NSQL with llama.cpp by referring to the GitHub repository or GGUF readme for instructions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>MK1 Flywheel Unlocks the Full Potential of AMD Instinct for LLM Inference</h2>
    <h3>Source: Mkone.ai</h3>
    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The new inference engine MK1 Flywheel enables AMD Instinct Series to achieve comparable performance to a compute-matched NVIDIA GPU.</li>
        <li>MK1 Flywheel demonstrates up to 3.7x higher throughput compared to vLLM, resulting in significant cost savings.</li>
        <li>AMD's Instinct MI300 series accelerator has the potential to challenge NVIDIA's dominance in cloud AI workloads.</li>
        <li>AMD's ROCm software stack has improved significantly, providing tight integration with popular AI frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.</li>
        <li>Building and optimizing the hardware and software components for AMD Instinct MI210 was a challenging but rewarding journey, showcasing the potential of the AMD Instinct Series.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>RAG Using Unstructured Data and Role of Knowledge Graphs</h2>
    <h3>Source: Kuzudb.com</h3>
    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The article discusses RAG systems that use unstructured data, such as text files or PDF documents, and refers to them as RAG-U systems.</li>
        <li>Two important design decisions for RAG-U systems are determining what additional data to include and how to store and fetch that data.</li>
        <li>The use of knowledge graphs (KGs) can be beneficial in RAG-U systems by linking chunks of text to entities in the KG, allowing for more relevant information retrieval.</li>
        <li>The article highlights the challenges of automatic knowledge graph construction and suggests that current language models are not yet competitive in extracting high-quality knowledge graph facts.</li>
        <li>The potential use of matrices instead of vectors for embedding chunks and questions in RAG-U systems is an area of future work, along with the evaluation of these systems on Q&A benchmarks.</li>
