  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The author used LLM embeddings to find related posts for their statically-generated blog.</li>
    <li>They also used GPT4 to explain why the related posts are similar.</li>
    <li>Embeddings are a mathematical representation of the meaning of a piece of text.</li>
    <li>Embeddings can be used for natural language search and to calculate relations between content.</li>
    <li>The author faced challenges with API rate limits, API token limits, GPT4 pricing, prompt tweaking, inconsistent output, hallucination, post deletion, and node memory while implementing the script.</li>
