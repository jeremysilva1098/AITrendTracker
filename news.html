<h1>Get Ready for the Great AI Disappointment</h1>
<h2>Source: Wired</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The article predicts that there will be a "Great AI Disappointment" in 2024, as the hype around generative AI and large language models will be overshadowed by their underwhelming performance and dangerous results.</li>
<li>The technology will face setbacks as evidence emerges that it provides false information and is prone to hallucination, where the AI makes things up and gets it wrong.</li>
<li>The article suggests that hopes for quick fixes to these problems will prove optimistic, as the architecture of these models makes it difficult to anchor predictions to known truths.</li>
<li>Anticipation for exponential improvements in productivity and progress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) will also be disappointed, and blame for failures will shift to faulty implementation by businesses.</li>
<li>The biggest use of generative AI will be in social media and online search, leading to increased manipulation, misinformation, and mental health problems associated with excessive screen time.</li>
