  <h2>Title: Nvidia unveils AI chatbot ‘Chat with RTX’ for local PCs</h2>
  <h3>Source: ReadWrite</h3>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Nvidia has released an early version of a chatbot called Chat with RTX, allowing users to personalize a chatbot with their own content on Windows PCs.</li>
    <li>The chatbot utilizes custom generative AI and requires an RTX 30 or 40-series GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM.</li>
    <li>Users can upload their own documents to create summaries and receive relevant answers based on their personal data.</li>
    <li>Chat with RTX can search YouTube URLs and transcripts for specific mentions or summarize entire videos.</li>
    <li>The chatbot can process sensitive data locally on a PC without the need to share it with a third party or have an internet connection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Title: Sora AI: ‘everyone will be filmmakers’, internet reacts to OpenAI’s new video generator</h2>
  <h3>Source: ReadWrite</h3>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>OpenAI has announced Sora, a new text-to-video AI that can create realistic and imaginative scenes from text instructions.</li>
    <li>Reactions to Sora have been varied, with some users enthusiastic and others wary.</li>
    <li>Sora has been praised for its ability to generate longer scenes compared to other video generation tools.</li>
    <li>Sora has limitations, including missing out on cause-and-effect details and finer spatial details.</li>
    <li>Sora is currently in a testing phase and it is unclear if it will be free to use when it launches, but OpenAI is working on safety measures to prevent misuse.</li>

  <h2>Title: Show me the prompt</h2>
  <h3>Source: Hamel.dev</h3>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Many libraries aim to improve the output of LLMs by rewriting or constructing prompts, but they often discourage users from understanding and manipulating the prompts themselves.</li>
    <li>Intercepting API calls can help engineers understand how these LLM frameworks work by examining the prompts sent to the language model.</li>
    <li>Setting up a proxy like mitmproxy can log outgoing API requests and provide insight into the prompts and API calls made by LLM frameworks.</li>
    <li>Examples from LLM libraries like Guardrails, Guidance, Langchain, Instructor, and DSPy demonstrate the value of intercepting API calls to gain a deeper understanding of how these frameworks function.</li>
    <li>It is important to evaluate the necessity and effectiveness of LLM frameworks, consider alternative approaches, and make informed decisions by inspecting prompts and API calls.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Title: Most older iPhones, Macs, and iPads are vulnerable to a new GPU security flaw</h2>
  <h3>Source: AppleInsider</h3>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A new GPU security flaw named LeftoverLocals allows attackers to access data processed in a device's GPU.</li>
    <li>Apple has patched the vulnerability in A17 iPhones and M3 Macs, but older models remain vulnerable.</li>
    <li>The vulnerability is significant because GPUs are increasingly used in AI for processing Large Language Models (LLMs).</li>
    <li>Users can protect themselves by not giving third-party access to their devices and installing the latest security updates from Apple.</li>
    <li>It is unclear if Apple has plans to patch the vulnerability in impacted devices going forward.</li>
  </ul>
