  <h2>Title: Show HN: My related-posts finder script (with LLM and GPT4 enhancement)</h2>
  <h3>Source: Tomhazledine.com</h3>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The author used LLM embeddings to find related posts for their blog and GPT-4 to explain why they are similar.</li>
    <li>Embeddings are a way to make LLMs useful without the worry of generating incorrect or "hallucinated" content.</li>
    <li>The author tried manual approaches and leaning on CMS features to generate related posts in the past but found limitations and issues with both methods.</li>
    <li>Embeddings are a mathematical representation of the meaning of a piece of text and can be used for natural language search and calculating relations between content.</li>
    <li>The author developed a node script that reads markdown files, generates embeddings, compares similarities, and uses GPT-4 to generate explanations for why posts are similar.</li>

  <h2>Title: How close are we to peak AI?</h2>
  <h3>Source: Business Insider</h3>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>OpenAI's GPT-4 remains unbeaten and no AI model has convincingly outperformed it since its release in March.</li>
    <li>The question now is whether generative AI, the most popular form of AI, has already reached its peak performance.</li>
    <li>While theoretical improvements are possible, achieving them in practice is challenging.</li>
    <li>Google's Gemini Ultra, released as a response to GPT-4, only slightly surpasses GPT-4 on performance benchmarks.</li>
    <li>The industry is still striving for artificial general intelligence (AGI), but there may be limitations with transformer models that hinder progress.</li>
