<h1>Top AI Blog Posts of the Week</h1>
<h2>Title: Show HN: My related-posts finder script (with LLM and GPT4 enhancement)</h2>
<h3>Source: Tomhazledine.com</h3>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The author used LLM embeddings to find related posts for their blog and GPT4 to explain why they're similar.</li>
<li>Embeddings are a way to make LLMs useful without worrying about "hallucination" or incorrect content.</li>
<li>The author previously tried manual and CMS-based approaches to generate related posts but found them impractical.</li>
<li>Embeddings are mathematical representations of the meaning of text, and their positions in a multi-dimensional space can determine the similarity between texts.</li>
<li>The author developed a script that reads markdown files, generates embeddings and summaries, and uses GPT4 to generate explanations for the similarity between posts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Title: Intel Neural-Chat-7B Model Achieves Top Ranking on LLM Leaderboard</h2>
<h3>Source: Intel.com</h3>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Intel neural-chat-7b model has achieved the top ranking for 7-billion-parameter models on the Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard.</li>
<li>The model achieved comparable accuracy scores to models 2-3x larger, making it suitable for deployment on a wide range of compute platforms.</li>
<li>The model is based on the Mistral-7B-v0.1 transformer model from Mistral AI and was fine-tuned using Intel Gaudi2 AI accelerators.</li>
<li>The fine-tuning process utilized direct preference optimization (DPO), which is more computationally efficient and does not require a reward model.</li>
<li>The Intel Extension for Transformers library provides tools for fine-tuning, customizing, and optimizing the NeuralChat chatbot based on this model.</li>
</ul>
