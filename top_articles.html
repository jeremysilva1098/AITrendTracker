<h2>Title: Know Your Audience: Do LLMs Adapt to Different Age and Education Levels?</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The study evaluates the adaptability of large language models (LLMs) to different age and education levels when generating answers to science questions.</li>
<li>The results show that current LLMs have limited adaptability to diverse audiences, even when prompted, and their generated answers are often not within the recommended readability range for specific age and education groups.</li>
<li>This lack of adaptability limits the potential of LLMs for educational purposes and highlights the need for enhancing their adaptability to cater to different age and education levels.</li>
<li>The study suggests that the metrics used to evaluate text difficulty and readability may not capture all the differences in the texts generated by LLMs, and alternative metrics need to be explored for machine-generated text.</li>
<li>Further advancements in LLM development and fine-tuning are necessary to ensure more reliable and effective adaptation to different audience segments.</li>

<h2>Title: On the Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Domain-Specific Code Generation</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The paper investigates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in generating domain-specific code and proposes strategies to improve their performance. The main findings are as follows:</li>
<li>LLMs exhibit sub-optimal performance in generating domain-specific code, mainly due to their limited proficiency in utilizing domain-specific libraries.</li>
<li>Incorporating API knowledge as prompts can enhance LLMs' ability to generate domain-specific code. API sequence prompts and docstring prompts are particularly effective.</li>
<li>Prompting LLMs with domain knowledge in a chain-of-thought manner improves the overall code generation performance.</li>
<li>Fine-tuning LLMs with domain-specific knowledge further enhances their effectiveness in generating domain-specific code.</li>

<h2>Title: Boosting legal case retrieval by query content selection with large language models</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Legal case retrieval is important for judgment justice and has received increasing attention.</li>
<li>Traditional retrieval models, both sparse and dense, have difficulty in perceiving salient content in long legal case queries.</li>
<li>Reformulating queries using large language models (LLMs) can improve the performance of retrieval models in legal case retrieval.</li>
<li>Different query reformulation methods, such as keyword extraction, key sentence extraction, and summarization, can enhance retrieval models to varying degrees.</li>
<li>The reformulated queries generated by LLMs can effectively highlight salient content and improve retrieval performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Title: CLAMP: Contrastive LAnguage Model Prompt-tuning</h2>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Large language models (LLMs) have been successful in various machine learning tasks, but they underperform in zero-shot image classification compared to specialized models.</li>
<li>Contrastive LAnguage Model Prompt-tuning (CLAMP) is a method that adapts LLMs for image classification by using a contrastive image-caption matching objective.</li>
<li>CLAMP achieves good image classification performance and retains the LLM's generative abilities.</li>
<li>CLAMP outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs by 13% on zero-shot classification tasks.</li>
<li>The performance of CLAMP is particularly strong in domains with low representation in the pre-training data.</li>
